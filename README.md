**🎮 How It Works**

Each player (human and computer) has their own gameboard.
Each fleet contains ships of different lengths.
The player attacks by clicking on the computer’s board cells.
The computer makes its moves automatically.
When all cells of a ship are hit, the ship sinks.
The first to destroy all enemy ships wins the game.
