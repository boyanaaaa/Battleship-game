**🎮 How It Works**

Each player (human and computer) has their own gameboard.<br>
Each fleet contains ships of different lengths.<br>
The player attacks by clicking on the computer’s board cells.<br>
The computer makes its moves automatically.<br>
When all cells of a ship are hit, the ship sinks.<br>
The first to destroy all enemy ships wins the game.<br>
